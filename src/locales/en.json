      "q3": "Do you provide maintenance after completion?",
      "a3": "Yes, all projects include a free maintenance period. After the maintenance period ends, you can choose to renew maintenance services to ensure your website remains stable and receives technical support.",
      "q4": "Can I see the design before deciding?",
      "a4": "Before formal development, I will provide website architecture planning and design drafts for your confirmation. Development only begins after the design direction meets your expectations, giving you peace of mind."
