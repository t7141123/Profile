      "q1": "How long does project development take?",
      "a1": "Development time depends on project complexity. Generally, a corporate website takes about 4-6 weeks, while more complex e-commerce platforms or custom systems may take 2-4 months. A project schedule will be provided before the project begins.",
      "q2": "How does the payment process work?",
      "a2": "We typically use installment payments: 30% deposit upon signing, 40% at mid-development, and 30% upon project completion. Payment terms can be flexibly adjusted based on project needs.",
      "q3": "Do you provide maintenance after completion?",
      "a3": "Yes, all projects include a free maintenance period, which includes free fixes for any software bugs found during this time. After the maintenance period ends, you can choose to renew maintenance services to ensure your website remains stable and receives technical support.",
      "q4": "What makes you different from other freelancers?",
      "a4": "Three things: First, a full-stack technical capability so you don't need multiple people; second, proactive communication so you're never left in the dark; third, a complete post-launch maintenance period for peace of mind.",

      "q5": "What if I'm not satisfied during the process?",
